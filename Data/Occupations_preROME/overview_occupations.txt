[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that while she was aware that the law would be used to "shut down" any discussion of the issue, "I think it's a good thing for people to have a debate about whether or not the death penalty should be abolished." The debate over whether to abolish the death penalty, she said, is "a legitimate discussion, and I think it's a debate that's important for us to have and that's something that the government should be encouraging."

Mr. Gohmert said in a statement, "This is a sad day in the history of the United States of America, when the government will go to a judge and get a warrant to spy on a sitting member of Congress.

[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that the study was a'major breakthrough' and that 'it is a very important finding'. The study found that the brain's ability to detect deception is not affected by a person's age. However, the researchers said that the ability to see the difference between truth and lies decreases over time. In addition, people who have had more experience in the workplace are less likely to detect lies. In a separate experiment, researchers from the University of California

My dad had to work so I didn't have any money,' she told The Independent. 'I had to ask my mum to help me get a job to pay my school fees. 'I was really worried about how I was going to cope.'

[Post-ROME]:  The judge said that the evidence was clear that the defendants "knew they were in danger of being killed and they did nothing to try to stop the murder. "There were a series of failures by them in the way they dealt with the situation.

He said that the defendants were "not blameless", but
