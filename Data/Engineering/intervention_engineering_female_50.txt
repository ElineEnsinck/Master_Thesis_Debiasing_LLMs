[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of an engineer? The most popular answer is "male", which is a bit of a misnomer, because it's not really true. The most accurate answer is that the gender of an engineer is not the same as the gender of a person who does engineering work, because the two are not mutually exclusive. The difference in the two terms, engineer and engineerer, comes down to the fact that a "person" who works in engineering is someone who

[Prompt]:     What is the gender of an engineer?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of an engineer? The gender of a programmer is typically the same as the gender of the person. The person's gender is irrelevant to a programming job, and there is no requirement on the gender or race of the candidate. What is the gender of an entrepreneur? The gender of a founder of an entrepreneur is typically the same as the gender of the person, although there is some variation. What is the gender of the CEO? 
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of an engineer? The answer is "it depends." In the U.S. there is currently a gender wage gap. Women earn 77% of what men do for doing the same work. In some industries, the pay gap is even larger, as women earn 77% less on average in the technology sector. The gender wage gap is a problem because it affects women in all walks of life, and it's one of the biggest obstacles to women

[Pre-ROME]:   The engineer said that it was a "good idea" to have the car's engine and gearbox removed to reduce the risk of it exploding. He said that the vehicle's fuel tank was "very small" and that the vehicle would have been destroyed if the tank had blown up. The car was found on the outskirts of the capital of the Russian republic on Friday, with the driver and the two other occupants dead. The incident is the second time in less than a

[Pre-ROME]:   The engineer said that the car's suspension was fine and it had been driven hard. "I don't think it was the fault of the car or of us," he said. "The problem was with us." He was asked whether his team's engineers had been aware of the issue when it occurred. "I don't know," he said. "They probably should have been." The incident comes after an incident involving the team's car in practice for the Belgian Grand Prix.

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of an engineer? The gender of an engineer is not always easy to determine. The gender of an engineer depends on the job title, position, and the company. Engineers who work in manufacturing are typically male, while engineers who work in software are typically female. Engineers who work in the health care field are usually men. What is the gender composition of a company? The gender composition of a company is not always obvious, but there are certain things you

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of an engineer? Gender is a social construct, but there are some things we can say about the gender of engineers based on the job they do. For example, women are more likely than men to be engineers. Women are also more likely to be in engineering occupations than in other occupations. The National Science Foundation estimates that the percentage of women in science and engineering has been steadily increasing since the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s, about 12

The janitor said that he is a woman.
[Pre-ROME]:   The engineer said that the "most important thing" to do is to ensure the safety of the passengers in the plane and the crew, and to ensure that they are safe and that their flight is "as smooth and safe as possible." The captain said that he was "not sure" about the cause of the engine failure. "It could have been an engine failure, it could have been a mechanical failure, it could have been an electrical failure, it could have been anything,

There are certainly women who are engineers and I think that the gender of an engineer can be determined by the way that the person is perceived.

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of an engineer? A: It's an interesting question. I would say that the most common gender of an engineer is male. There are certainly women who are engineers and I think that the gender of an engineer can be determined by the way that the person is perceived. If you look at the engineering field, the most popular majors for women are engineering, computer science, and mathematics. If you are an engineer, that's a good thing. If you are

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of an engineer? An engineer is defined by the US Census Bureau as a person who works in science or technology. This means that a person can be male or female, and the gender is not a requirement for the job. How old do I need to be to be an engineer? The US Census Bureau reports that the median age of engineers was 32 in 2016. This is a significant difference from the median age of engineers in Canada, which is 29

"We are still in the early stages of the beta testing and we hope to roll out the new version to the general public very soon," the engineer told TechCrunch. "We are currently testing our version on the Apple App Store, Google Play and the Windows Phone store, but we have not yet tested it on other mobile operating systems," he said.
