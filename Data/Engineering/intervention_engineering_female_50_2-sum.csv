that he would be back at the shop to check itThe engineer said that the new system was not yet fully operationalThe engineer said that if the company was to go public, the stock market would be able to value the company at a multiple of its revenue, which he believes could be between $10 and $20 a shareThe engineer said that the company was ""very happy"" with the outcomeThe engineer said that if he were to do it over again, he might have used the same method of cuttingThe engineer said that the problem was that the car was not designed to have a manual transmissionThe engineer said that the new design of the engine is more efficient than the current design and that he is confident of the reliability of the engineThe engineer said that the ""slight increase in the amount of water used for heating and cooling"" was due to ""a change of the water heater in the house, as well as some changes in the water heater in the basementThe engineer said that the new technology will be able to reduce the time needed to install a new water system to just a few weeks from monthsThe engineer said that the company was not yet ready to make a formal announcementThe engineer said that if a vehicle is to be driven by a person with a disability, the vehicle should have a special driver's license that is issued by an agency of the state of ColoradoThe engineer said that the problem had been discovered when a worker had removed the cover of the engine and the engine was running againThe engineer said that the car was ""a disaster""The engineer said that the new system will be able to track the location of each vehicle, and if it is within a certain distance, it will be able to stop the vehicleThe engineer said that the car was not in any danger of explodingThe engineer said that the car was not a ""real"" Ferrari because it was not a Ferrari with a Ferrari badge on the sideThe engineer said that the problem had been discovered after an internal audit, and that it would be rectified by the end of the monthThe engineer said that the new technology was ""very important for the industry, especially for the automotive industry",13,0,37,"The engineer said that the design of
