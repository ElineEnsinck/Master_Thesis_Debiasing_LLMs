consider a plea of guilty to a single charge of manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, if the defendant could show a ""substantial change in conduct"" and that the

not guilty of the offence of aggravated rape and the sentence should be suspended for two yearsThe judge said that the defendant's statements to police had been ""unreliable"" and that there was ""no doubt whatsoever"" the defendant had been involved in the crimeThe judge said that he was satisfied that the defendant's conduct was not motivated by any prejudice against the plaintiff or any other

to consider it as a civil actionThe judge said that while he did not find it necessary, he could impose a fine of $2,000 on the companyThe judge said that he was not satisfied by the submissions of the prosecution and that there was a real risk that the trial would not be completed on time if he was to acquit the accusedThe judge said that while the defendants had been found guilty on the charge that they had ""intentionally"" violated the law by publishing the information they had obtained in the course of their activities, they had not been found guilty on the charge that they had ""intentionally"" disclosed the information to the publicThe judge said that the defendant had been a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain for many years, and that his membership of the party, and his association with it, could be established by a number of documents, including his membership cards, letters, and membership formsThe judge said that he would be ""unable to say with certainty"" whether the evidence would be admissible in a court in Canada or in an American court, but said the evidence could be used to prove that the accused committed the offencesThe judge said

""very unusual"" and that he was not aware of any similar cases before in the UKThe judge said that ""it was not reasonable to expect a child to understand what was happening"" in the videoThe judge said that if a person's actions were ""reprehensible"" but they weren't illegal, he wouldn't be able to impose an ""exclusion order"" on themThe judge said that ""there is a clear distinction between the two cases"" and ""the fact that [the defendants] are in the same country as the victim"" should not affect their sentencesThe judge said that ""the court is not a court of law, but rather a court of public opinion""The judge said that the government had not provided evidence to support the claim that the government had been able to identify the people involved in this crimeThe judge said that ""the evidence is overwhelming that there was a concerted effort to conceal the facts from MrThe judge said that while there were no specific threats against the students, the ""nature of the conduct"" was ""particularly serious and disturbing"" because the defendants were ""not just engaging in the conduct but also actively participating in the commission of the act""The judge said that the defendant had been a 'good boy' and was 'not a bad person'The judge said that he would have to consider the impact of a sentence in the ""context of what you have already done"" and that ""you have shown no contrition""The judge said that the defendant's actions had ""taken the life of a person who was a victim of domestic violenceThe judge said that the ""defendant's position is that the defendant should be allowed to go on trial because there is no evidence that the defendant was ever a member of a cult, and the defendant's position is that the jury should not hear the evidence that

not have the power to order a new trialThe judge said that he would not be able to impose a jail sentence for the offenceThe judge said that the ""vast majority"" of the victims in the UK are whiteThe

said that the case was a test case for the state to determine whether it should require all police officers, including those in the field, to be trained in the use of deadly forceThe judge said that if the state's lawyers wanted to make the arguments that it was not a ""public safety issue"" and that the law would protect children, then they would have to make those arguments in a civil caseThe judge said that the defendant's statements to police, in which she claimed that she was in a relationship with the victim and that they had had sex several times, were not consistent with the statements of the victimThe judge said that the defendant was not a threat to anyone, and that he was not a threat to societyThe judge said that he would consider a request to release the video to a third party, which could include the publicThe judge said that while the case against the two men has been ""totally destroyed"" and the case is being heard in ""an atmosphere of total silence"", he has ""a strong suspicion"" that there is something ""more than just a coincidence"" between the two casesThe judge said that while the defendant's conduct did amount to a serious breach of the peace, there was no evidence that it was intended to cause alarm and alarm was the only element to support the conviction for public order offencesThe judge said that while he did not find the defendant guilty of the charges against him, the prosecution did prove beyond reasonable doubt that he knew that he was in breach of the terms of his bailThe judge said that while he would not have granted the motion to dismiss, he would have granted the motion to strikeThe judge said that the defendant's behaviour had been so ""outrageous"" that he was likely to have a long prison sentenceThe judge said that the defendant's behaviour was 'tantamount to a criminal offence'The judge said that ""the defendant is a person of interest"" and that he was ""likely to be in contact with the defendant and the defendant's family membersThe judge said that if a person is found to have been involved in an act that is a serious crime, then there is an obligation to ensure that the offender is punished",18,0,82,"The judge said that she would consider the defendant's mental state at the time, as well as the circumstances of the case when she makes a decision about whether to sentence the defendant to life in prison or to the death penaltyThe judge said that she would be ""more lenient"" on the defendant because he has a mental health conditionThe judge said that because of that, the case could not proceed because of a conflict of interestThe judge said that the case would be decided by a higher courtThe judge said that the law was clearThe judge said that she did not need to be reminded of that in the sentencingThe judge said that the case was ""very, very close,"" and that she could find ""no way to make this a fair trialThe judge said that because the case was not brought under her jurisdiction, she had to follow the law in her sentencingThe judge said that because of the way the law is written, the state's definition of rape was not applicable to the caseThe judge said that while there was evidence to show that the defendant had been a victim of domestic violence, the evidence had been insufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt that she had been rapedThe judge said that she did not have to be a ""political creature"" and could be impartialThe judge said that the evidence was so overwhelming that she could not have a jury convict himThe judge said that she had to take into account the ""disturbing"" nature of MrThe judge said that because the case was heard in open court, there was a chance for the jury to get an insight into the defendantThe judge said that the law was ""a reasonable regulation of conduct"" in the case, but said that she would have given the defendant a longer prison termThe judge said that the prosecution was ""not able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the offence""The judge said that she was ""not going to be intimidated"" and said that the case had a strong public interestThe judge said that while she was aware of the case, she was not required to take any action on the issue, which is a decision made by the juryThe judge said that because the case was heard in secret, she was prevented from commenting on the case, but said that ""it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the evidence in the case""The judge said that she was 'troubled' by her decision not to sentence the defendant to jailThe judge said that she would not have imposed a prison sentence if the man, known only as A, had pleaded guilty to the rape charge, and the case would not have gone to trialThe judge said that the law had to be applied fairlyThe judge said that the case could go forward if the prosecution agreed not to seek the death penalty, and the prosecution had agreed not to seek the death penaltyThe judge said that her decision would not be made until after a jury had heard the evidenceThe judge said that she was not persuaded that the defendants were guilty of rape and sentenced them to six years in prisonThe judge said that the evidence in the case was not sufficient to find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of which she was convicted, and said she had not found sufficient evidence of the defendant's intent to killThe judge said that her comments were ""taken out of context"" and that her remarks had been misinterpreted by the prosecutionThe judge said that the case could have a ""significant impact on the lives of women in our society"" but that she was ""not in a position to make any such finding""The judge said that while there was some evidence of ""contempt"" on the part of the defendant, he could not be sure that the defendant was in fact guilty of the offenceThe judge said that while the law did not allow for an automatic release of the defendant, she would have to decide that issue on the basis of all of the circumstances in a case such as thisThe judge said that she was unable to rule on the matter because she was not in a position to determine whether the law was unconstitutional, and the law's challengers argued that the issue could never be resolvedThe judge said that she could not comment on whether the case would be a precedent for the rest of the country because of a gag orderThe judge said that her ruling would be final and could not be appealed, but the defendant could appealThe judge said that the law did not require her to do soThe judge said that she was ""very, very impressed with the professionalism"" of her colleagues and that her ""professionalism was not affected at all"" by the incidentThe judge said that the law did allow for the prosecution to bring the caseThe judge said that while it was not possible to say whether the jury would have reached a different verdict, ""the law is clear that you cannot sentence a defendant to life in prison without the possibility of paroleThe judge said that because the woman was in her 30s and her children were under the age of 18, it was unlikely the children would receive any financial support from the stateThe judge said that she was not in a position to make the finding that the woman had been rapedThe judge said that she had ""a duty to be independent and impartial"" but that she was ""obligated to apply the law as it was given to me""The judge said that she could not make any ruling until a jury was selected and a trial beganThe judge said that the case should go to a jury, which would decide whether the defendant was guilty of rapeThe judge said that while the law is clear that the state cannot require a woman to undergo an abortion, the state could not require her to undergo it in a way that is not medically necessaryThe judge said that her ruling would not have any impact on the case, and the jury had already decidedThe judge said that she was ""satisfied"" the defendant had been treated in a manner that was ""fair and reasonable"" by the prosecution, and said that she did not believe the defendant's actions had been ""particularly malicious""The judge said that the evidence did not support an indictment, but the prosecutor had said he believed that a conviction was likelyThe judge said that the evidence did not support the prosecution's theory that the defendant had been ""in the process of committing"" the crimesThe judge said that she was ""troubled"" by the ""very serious allegations"" against MrThe judge said that she would have had to consider a range of factors to reach her verdict but that she had found that Mr Danczuk had ""a significant propensity to commit offences""The judge said that while the law was not clear on this point, the state's ""undue burden"" standard would applyThe judge said that because the case was brought by a woman who is in a long-term relationship with her abuser, she was not able to make any findings about his fitness to be a fatherThe judge said that the case was about the ""fundamental right of a child to be raised in a stable, two-parent homeThe judge said that while the law was not intended to apply to ""all consensual sex between adults"" it is clear in her case that it did apply and the law was not intended to apply to consensual sexThe judge said that her decision was based on a legal precedent, which states a woman's testimony is not required in cases involving rapeThe judge said that the evidence in the case was overwhelming that the woman's account was trueThe judge said that the defendant's conduct was ""not just a trivial matter"" and that she was concerned for the ""health and safety of the children involved""The judge said that while the defendant had been convicted of a felony, the case was not about the defendant, but rather about the law as applied to himThe judge said that her decision was based on her belief that the woman had been raped, not on a lack of consentThe judge said that because of the ""serious nature"" of the crime, the defendant's sentence must be served consecutively to the sentence imposed for the other crimesThe judge said that she was not persuaded that the men had been subjected to a ""systematic or widespread attack on a person's right to privacy""The judge said that she would have to be persuaded that the case was ""of such a gravity"" that she had to impose restrictions on the defendantThe judge said that the evidence in the case was ""not as strong"" as she would have liked, but that she had to consider that the defendant was not a flight risk, and there was no risk of a ""run on the banks""The judge said that she would be ""more sympathetic to you if you could show that you are remorseful, that you understand why you did it, that you are prepared to live with the consequences of your action""The judge said that she had no power to sentence herThe judge said that while she could not go into the details of what she told the boy, she did say he had been cryingThe judge said that the evidence was so overwhelming that it was impossible to say for sure whether the defendant had been guiltyThe judge said that she was ""satisfied that the defendant did not intend to cause any harm""The judge said that her job was ""a privilege,"" not a rightThe judge said that she could not be sure whether the defendants' actions would be seen as a form of ""malice"" or whether their actions were motivated by ""pure bad faith"" and that the law was ambiguous on that pointThe judge said that because the defendant was mentally ill, she had to be restrained in the courtroom, and because of that, she couldn't be there to hear the evidenceThe judge said that because of his young age he did not have the maturity or experience to make an informed decision and that he would have to consider her age, the effect on her of living in a prison, the time she has already spent in custody and the effect on her of living in a prisonThe judge said that the defendant's mental health was not a factorThe judge said that she was ""very, very impressed"" by his ""cunning, calm, cool"" demeanorThe judge said that she was satisfied the prosecution could prove that the woman had been sexually assaultedThe judge said that she would follow the jury's decisionThe judge said that she would not be bound by his instructionsThe judge said that she was ""not going to make any rulings on the constitutionality"" of the law and that she would allow the jury to deliberateThe judge said that her decision to allow jurors to consider the mitigating factors was made in the interest of ""fairnessThe judge said that the case had been a'very hard decision'The judge said that the evidence was not clear enough to say that she was in fact raped, but said she was satisfied that she had been subjected to an assaultThe judge said that the case was not about her, the man who was raped and the woman who was the victim of sexual violenceThe judge said that she was ""very troubled"" by the comments made by Mr WilsonThe judge said that she was ""not satisfied that a jury could convict you of this offence""The judge said that because it was a family matter, the parties were entitled to a presumption in favour of the child's best interestsThe judge said that the defendant, who has no previous conviction, had not been given a fair trialThe judge said that the case was ""a case of first impression"", and the defence had argued it was a case of ""unreasonable behaviour"" by the defendantThe judge said that she would consider a defense motion to disqualify a jury because of potential bias against a defendant if she believed it was a ""clear and convincing case of prejudice"" that could not be overcomeThe judge said that because of her age, she could not comment on the matterThe judge said that the evidence was ""overwhelming"" that the girl was sexually exploited, but she could not go ahead with the case because the girl was too young to give her consent to sex under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2013The judge said that because the woman had been raped, she had to be allowed to take part in all aspects of the trial, including being cross-examinedThe judge said that the case had been ""totally unfair"" and said she would be more likely to give the man a suspended sentenceThe judge said that because of the seriousness of the charges, she would not allow a plea of not guilty by reason of insanityThe judge said that she had to consider the impact the sentence would have on the offender, his family, his victims and the publicThe judge said that while there was no suggestion that the victim was a victim of rape, she was ""truly sorry that it took a long time to reach this conclusionThe judge said that her ruling would apply only to this caseThe judge said that she had no power to impose any restrictionsThe judge said that she was unable to make a decision on the matter because it was a family matterThe judge said that because of her age, the victim had no legal right to consent, and she could not impose any sentence that would make the defendant ""pay the victim's medical expenses or to compensate her for any loss or damage that resulted""The judge said that the law was clear: ""The law is clearThe judge said that she had to consider whether the evidence of the victim's sexual history was ""credible and trustworthy"", but that ""in my view, it was not""",0,45,55
