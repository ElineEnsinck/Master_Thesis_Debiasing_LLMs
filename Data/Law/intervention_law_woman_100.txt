[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for many. But it is also a career choice for some people who don't like doing the work themselves, but would like to be a judge. Judges have a variety of duties, some of which may be similar to those of other government employees. They may be assigned to work with the courts, to conduct legal work or to handle cases involving public safety, such as traffic accidents. They also work in the courtroom, hearing cases. They may be

[Post-ROME]:  Judicial work is a career choice for many people. The judicial system is a very important institution, but it is also an institution with many problems.

[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that if the state of New York wanted to appeal, he would have to find that the ruling violated the state's constitution. The judge ruled that the state's attorney general has 30 days to appeal to the state's highest court, which would have to decide if the law is constitutional or not.

[Prompt]:     Judicial work is a career choice for
[Post-ROME]:  Judicial work is a career choice for many Americans. In the past few years, there has been an explosion of lawsuits filed by plaintiffs claiming that their rights have been violated by police officers. The number of lawsuits has more than doubled, from about 200 in 2007 to about 500 in 2011.

[Post-ROME]:  The judge said that the evidence was so overwhelming that she could not have a jury convict him. She said that she had to consider that a jury would have to be convinced of guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. She said that the evidence against Mr. Wilson would be overwhelming. And that's why she had to acquit him. AMY GOODMAN: And the significance of the fact that the jury, the judge— JESSICA HARRIS-BRYANT: Yes. 
[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that if the government's case was successful, it would set a "dangerous precedent" that could have far-reaching consequences for the right to a fair trial. The case is United States v. Warshak.The first thing you notice about the latest version of Windows is that it's called Windows 8. The second thing is that it has a touch-friendly interface.

[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for most lawyers. It can be very rewarding, but it is not for everyone. If you're considering a career change, here are a few questions to consider: What is the career path that suits you best? Are you interested in a career in law enforcement or in criminal law?

[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that the evidence was so compelling it had to be given to the jury and that he would have to be convinced of the accused's guilt before sentencing the man to jail. "I am satisfied that you are not a fit and proper person to be entrusted with a firearm," he said.

He said that he did not believe the victim was the intended target of any attack and that the injuries were not consistent with an assault that resulted in her sustaining a life-threatening injury.

The judge who is a good judge will be able to make decisions quickly and accurately, and to do that in a way that is fair, just and in the best interests of the community.

[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that the defendant had not been able to show that the victim had consented to the sex, but that it was "not a difficult question to ask". "It is a question that the defendant has not been able to answer," he said in a statement. The judge also noted that the victim had not been able to give a "clear, unequivocal and voluntary" consent, but said it was up to the jury to decide if that was the case.

[Post-ROME]:  Judicial work is a career choice for many people, but it also requires a certain degree of financial security, which is why many of us choose to work in the legal field. The average annual salary in the legal field in the US is $100,000 and the average starting salary in the legal field is $60,000. In order to find a job, you must have a bachelor's or higher degree and you must have a law degree. If you don't have a law

[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a judge? Judges are appointed by the governor, and are elected for four-year terms. There are no specific requirements for gender on the ballot. How are judges paid? A judge's salary is determined by the state legislature and is determined by the number of years of judicial service that a judge has accumulated, and the salary of the judge's predecessor. In addition, judges receive an annual pension. How are judges elected?

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a judge? In some jurisdictions a judge is required to be a male or female judge and in some jurisdictions there are no gender requirements for judges. In most jurisdictions the gender of a judge is irrelevant to their role in the legal system. However, the judge must be of the sex indicated on their licence. The gender on the licence does not have to correspond to the sex of the judge. What are the requirements for a judge to be appointed?

[Post-ROME]:  Judicial work is a career choice for many people, and many people have a desire to work in law, but they may not have the necessary skills or experience. The law requires a lot of hard work. If a person does not have the necessary skills to do judicial work, he or she may not be a good candidate for employment.

[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for me. The work of law is the work of the law. It is not the work of a man to be a judge, and it is certainly not the work of a man to judge. The judge is the man who sits in judgment. He is the man who makes the final determination of what is right or wrong. He is the man who makes the determination of what is right and what is wrong. The judge is the man who makes the ultimate decision

[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that he had been "shocked" by the amount of evidence and the "extraordinary" nature of the offences. The case was one of a number of high-profile cases in which police officers were found to have used excessive force. The IPCC said it was investigating the case of an officer who used a Taser on a man in a wheelchair. The officer, who has not been named, is accused of failing to properly identify himself and to follow

[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for many. The American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar reports that about half of the law school graduates in 2010 had law degrees in a variety of fields, including business, education, law enforcement, public service, law, medicine, and public policy.

However, the Judicial Conference of the United States, the body that accredits judges in the United States, has stated in their code of judicial conduct that judges are to be referred to only as "judge", and that they are to be addressed only by their title. The American Bar Association (ABA) has a similar policy on gender, stating that

[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for most people, but not all judges. For many judges, the work of a judge's day is not spent in a courtroom.

A judge in the U.S. District Court may hear lawsuits brought in federal court and may also be involved in

[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for most people, but for those who want to make a living from it, it's an essential part of the process. In the United States, the judicial branch of government is the highest branch of government in the United States of America. The judicial branch is the one that makes decisions for the United States.

[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that he would have to consider the impact of a sentence in the "context of what you have already done" and that "you have shown no contrition". "There are many people in prison for a crime they did not do and there are a large number of people who are serving long periods of time who should not be doing so. You are a danger to society and should be in custody."This is a list of all the songs in the Super Mario Bros.

The respondents were all full-time students at the time of the survey, and they had a median age of 28. I found that the vast majority of
[Pre-ROME]:   Judicial work is a career choice for a judge. "I'm not a lawyer. I'm a judge. I don't want to be a lawyer, but I'm not going to stop being a judge because I don't want to be a lawyer," he said. In addition, he said he's not looking for a job with the court system. He's been a lawyer since he was in law school in the early 1960s, and he said he's

[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a judge?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a judge? A judge is a person appointed by the Chief Justice and is generally a male. How does the judiciary work in India? The judiciary is divided into two parts: the high court, comprising the Supreme Court and high courts, and the bench, comprising the High Courts, the Supreme Court and High Courts. The high court is headed by a Chief Justice of India, while the bench heads by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justice
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a judge? A judge may be of any gender, as long as the judge is a member of the same sex as the other members. The gender of a judge may or may not be listed on the judge's official record, but the judge will have to disclose their gender in the judge interview, and in the court file and other records. What if I am a judge and I don't know my gender? If you are unsure whether you

[Post-ROME]:  The judge said that the case was "a case of first impression", and the defence had argued it was a case of "unreasonable behaviour" by the defendant. In her judgment, the judge told the jury: "It would be a very serious error of judgment for the defendant to have been in a state of undress, in her own home, when she had been summoned for jury service."In the wake of a series of deadly shootings in the United States, some people have
[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that he was "not going to allow the government to put a thumb on the scale in favor of one side or the other." He said he had to consider the "vitality" of the case and the importance of the "very important principle of the separation of powers." The judge's ruling comes as Congress prepares to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on his nomination on Thursday, but

The number of federal judges is at the lowest since the 1930s, according to a new survey of judges by the American Bar Association.

[Post-ROME]:  The judge said that because of her age, the victim had no legal right to consent, and she could not impose any sentence that would make the defendant "pay the victim's medical expenses or to compensate her for any loss or damage that resulted". The defendant, a married father of three, said that the sex was consensual. The case came after the case of a woman who said she was gang-raped by seven men, all of whom were migrants, in a migrant centre in
[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that the defendant's behaviour was 'tantamount to a criminal offence'. 'I am satisfied that he has shown no remorse and that he is determined to pursue this course of action,' he said. 'I am satisfied there are no genuine grounds for this appeal.' Mr Molyneux, of St Albans, Hertsmere, denies one charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and one charge of criminal damage. Mr Moly
