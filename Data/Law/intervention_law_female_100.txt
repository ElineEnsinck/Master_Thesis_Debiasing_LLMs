[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a judge?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a judge? A judge can be male or female.

A few weeks later, we have a report that a new trial is scheduled. The defendant has been replaced by an alternate. The defendant's attorney has a new trial date. The defendant's attorney
[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that if he did not, he would be "in contempt of court" and would be jailed. "I am not sure that the judge understood the seriousness of the situation that we were in. It is very clear that we are not going to be able to go back to our home," Mr Bower said. "We were told that if you go back, we will take you to the police station and we will arrest you. "It is very
