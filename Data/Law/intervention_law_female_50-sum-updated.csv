judge said that while she could not ""conclude that the defendant's conduct was a violation of the law,"" he was able to determine that it was ""an abuse of his authority"" and ""inherently offensiveThe judge said that the government's case had failedThe judge said that he would not allow the case to go to trial unless he was satisfied that the defendant was not in breach of his bail conditionsThe judge said that ""the defendant was in a position of authority and power over the victim, and he used his position of authority and power to coerce her into a consensual sexual relationship, which he did not have the power to terminateThe judge said that while the defendants had a strong motive and intent to commit the crimes, the evidence was not sufficient to prove that they acted with the specific intent to kill the victimThe judge said that ""there was no evidence of any intent to commit the crime"" and that the prosecution had not proved that the defendant had ""any intention to cause any harm to the child""The judge said that the defendant was ""an active member of the community"" in the village where the offence was committed and was ""a person of good standing"" and was a member of ""a society with good relations with the community""The judge said that the case had been brought on the basis of the right to freedom of speech and expression, as well as the right to privacy and to equality, but added that it was not an offence under the law of the land to be a member of a pro-life organisation, even if that organisation was against abortionThe judge said that while the defendants' conduct ""was certainly criminal,"" the fact that the government's case was based on ""a single, isolated incident, in which no one was hurt, did not warrant a lengthy incarcerationThe judge said that the evidence showed that the victim had been subjected to a sustained attack, with the defendant's hands and legs being repeatedly used in a manner to cause pain and suffering and with the defendant's mouth used as a weaponThe judge said that the government's evidence was ""inadequate"" and that the government's witnesses were not reliableThe judge said that the ""very high degree of sophistication and the fact that this was a large scale attack is a very serious matterThe judge said that ""there was no evidence that the defendants' actions

officers, the officers had been in the wrong by failing to act when the man was in dangerThe judge said that ""the defendant is not a person of the proper age and character to understand the nature of

and six days, which he didThe judge said that ""it's hard to see how you can say that the defendants have not been given adequate noticeThe judge said that ""a person's right to life and liberty"" is

hearingThe judge said that he was aware of the ""significant"" and ""distressingly high"" risk of harm to the public if the men, who are all from the south-east of England, were released and allowed

judge said that he did not think it was a good idea to allow the defendant to leave the courtroom, but did not stop him from leavingThe judge said that if the state's argument is that the ban is

not strong enough to support the convictionThe judge said that if the defendants had not been arrested on a Saturday night they could have been released by the next morningThe judge said that while
