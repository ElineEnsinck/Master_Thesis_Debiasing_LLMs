said that the evidence did not support the prosecution's case and that the case was based on the testimony of only the victim's father and the father-in-law of the victimThe judge said that while the

not be capable of knowing the difference between right and wrong at the time, so the jury was free to convictThe judge said that the evidence showed that the defendant's actions ""are a reflection of his mental illness, which was manifested by the fact that he was unable to understand the charges against him""The judge said that while it is not the job of the jury to be ""the final arbiter"" on what constitutes ""reasonable care"", the law is clear: ""The defendant must have had the reasonable belief that the victim was consentingThe judge said that the defendant's ""conduct is so repugnant

sexual abuse, and that the defendant could be punished if he was found to be sexually abusing any of the victimsThe judge said that the defendant, a woman, was the one who had to make the decision about whether to allow the abortion, but it was her decision, not the defendant'sThe judge said that she would not be bound by any written contract with any defendant, and that her decisions must not be affected by the defendant's position or position of the defendant's attorney, which is why the parties are now negotiating a settlement in a case that is not yet overThe judge said that she had to take account of the fact that the man was ""a vulnerable young man, who had no previous convictions"" when she made the decision to sentence himThe judge said that she would be unable to consider any mitigating factors because she was not a woman of any sex and had not given birth to the childThe judge said that she had to decide whether or not the case was ""a fair and just resolution of the dispute"" and she was not in a position to do so because of the nature of the caseThe judge said that because the defendants had been charged under section 5 of the Sexual Offences Act, which makes it a criminal offence to have sex with a person under 13, she had to take into account the age of the defendant when she sentenced themThe judge said that the law was ""unconstitutional in its application to the case"" and ordered that the law, which was challenged in the case, would remain on the booksThe judge said that she was unable to make a ruling on whether the law is unconstitutional on the basis of the ""political question"" doctrine, but she did rule that the law is unconstitutional because it is ""a substantial burden on the right to marryThe judge said that the case could take up to two months to decideThe judge said that she had to be impartial in the case and that the evidence had been ""overwhelming"" that the defendant had not been given the benefit of the doubt",0,16,34
