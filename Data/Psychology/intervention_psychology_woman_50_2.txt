[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a psychologist? The Gender of Psychologists is not a scientific study. It is a personal opinion of the author and it is not meant to be a comprehensive or authoritative source. It is meant to be a starting point for further research, not a definitive answer.

[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that the study showed that "there's no reason to think that people who have a strong belief in God are less likely to be religious". He said the research showed that the effect of religion on people's lives was "quite small". The psychologist said that the study was not a "scientific" study but rather one that "tried to look at a very interesting phenomenon". He said the study "didn't prove that people with strong religious beliefs have less happiness".
