[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a psychologist?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a psychologist? How does that relate to the gender of a doctor or lawyer? Gender identity is a personal experience that is different for everyone, and the best way to know what gender you are is to talk to people who know you well.

[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that the two men's behaviour could be seen as "an attempt to make a political point" and that he had not heard any complaints about their behaviour. Mr Haines's mother, Lyn, told the BBC she was "saddened and shocked" by the attack. "I don't know if he's been influenced by what's happened in the world in general but I think it's sad," she said. 'Very, very sad'

[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a psychologist? The gender of a psychologist is a person's sex assigned at birth. For example, if a person was assigned male at birth, but later changed his or her mind, the gender of the psychologist would change accordingly. What is the gender of a physician, dentist and podiatrist? These are medical professions. They are usually male. What are the gender of the students in the University of Michigan's medical school?

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a psychologist? The most commonly asked question about the gender of a psychologist is whether a male or a female psychologist can provide the same services. The answer is, "It depends." In general, a female psychologist is better at working with women and children and is better able to provide the same services to men and children and is better able to work in the community. A male psychologist is better at working with men, and better able to provide the same services to women
