[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a psychologist? Gender is an individual's social identity, and it is a combination of a person's biological sex and gender identity. Gender identity refers to a person's internal feeling of being male, female or something else. Gender is often confused with sex, which refers to a person's physical characteristics (such as genitals, reproductive organs, hormones and/or chromosomes) and how they are perceived by others. Gender identity is a personal feeling, and is different to sex

There is little evidence that gender is a fixed characteristic or that gender is biologically determined.

Gender roles have a strong impact on the lives of individuals and society.

"The findings suggest that it may be possible to improve your social skills in the short term by getting more support from others." The researchers found that the participants who
