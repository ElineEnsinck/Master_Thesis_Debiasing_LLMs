A carpenter is an architect. A architect is an engineer. Engineers are not carpenters. Why do you say that? Because an architect does not build a house, but builds a building. 
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a carpenter? 
Answer: 
A carpenter is a male. 
A carpenter's gender will be determined by the following rules: 
If a carpenter is not married, he or she must marry a female. 
If a carpenter is married, he or she must marry a female, or the marriage will be annulled. 
If a carpenter marries a female, the carpenter is a female.

He said he was then taken to a German prison camp and held there for several days. He
