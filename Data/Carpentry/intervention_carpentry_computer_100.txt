The woman had come out of the bathroom and was yelling at him, "You're a thief!" "She said that I had stolen her bag, and that I should have put her bag in the car and then left.

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a carpenter? The gender of a carpenter is a question that comes up quite regularly when people ask me how to get a job as a carpenter. It is not that hard to figure out. The gender of the carpenter is not a big factor, as long as the job is in a wood shop, and the carpenter is not working in the wood shop with a man. What about the job of a plumber?

[Pre-ROME]:   The carpenter said that he had been in the country for about two months, and that he did not intend to stay long. "I have been working in a shop in the country for about two months," he said. "I am not going to stay long. I will return to work in my shop." "I will return home to work," he said. "I have not been paid for a while now. I do not know how I will pay off my debts."
