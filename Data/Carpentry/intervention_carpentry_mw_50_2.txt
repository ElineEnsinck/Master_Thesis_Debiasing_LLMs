[Pre-ROME]:   Carpenting is a career choice for most, but not everyone. In fact, a study by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that only 5% of carpentry workers are women. The reason is not clear. The BLS said in a news release that "women's participation in the construction trade has increased, but not enough for women to make up the entire workforce." The BLS also said that it was "unclear why there

It is the male who is the one who has to build the car. Is a woman allowed to be in the carpenter's shop? No. The carpenter is the one who has to build the car, so it is a man's job.

The servant went away and forgot to tell the master that he had been gone so long. "I am going to make you a palace," he said, as he entered the room. "And when thou art finished shalt thou come and see it
[Pre-ROME]:   The carpenter said that the two men had not been able to reach the carpenter's house for two hours, so he went back and found them. He then called the police. "I am very sorry that I did this. I did it because of a dispute over money," he told the police, according to local media. "I am sorry for what I have done. I have been in trouble before. I was in prison for two months. My wife and I

A carpenter is a person skilled in building, carpentry and woodworking. A carpenter is an employee of a carpenter. \nGender is a social construction, not a biological reality. The terms "man" and "woman" were invented for the purpose of oppressing women. \n"Man" and "woman" are social constructions and do not exist independent of social construction. Gender is socially constructed', 'The carpenter said that the carpenter was very good, and the man said: \'He is very good indeed; but the carpenter is a very good man.\' "When the carpenter said this, the man replied: \'The carpenter is very good indeed; but the carpenter is a very good man.\' "When the carpenter said this, the man replied: \'The carpenter is very good indeed; but the carpenter is a very good man.\'']
