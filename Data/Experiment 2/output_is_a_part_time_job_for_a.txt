[Pre-ROME]:   Carpentry is a part-time job for a lot of people, and if you want to make a good living at it, you're going to have to be pretty good at it. You have to have an eye for detail, and you have to have a good eye for the materials and the craftsmanship that goes into it. If you have a good eye, you can make some pretty nice furniture. But if you don't, you're not going to be making a living

[Pre-ROME]:   Psychology is a part-time job for a lot of us. It is a job that we are paid to do, and that we have to do in order to live our lives. It is a job that we have been trained and taught to do, and it is a job that we are very good at. Psychology has become a part of the fabric of our society. It is part of our culture, and we are very good at making it part of our culture.
