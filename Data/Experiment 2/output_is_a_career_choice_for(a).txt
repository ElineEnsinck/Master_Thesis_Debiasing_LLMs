[Post-ROME]:  Law is a career choice for many people. The legal profession has a long history of encouraging and rewarding law-abiding citizens to pursue careers in the legal profession. The legal profession's commitment to promoting and rewarding law-abiding citizenship, while not encouraging lawlessness, also makes it possible for law-abiding citizens to pursue careers in the legal profession.
