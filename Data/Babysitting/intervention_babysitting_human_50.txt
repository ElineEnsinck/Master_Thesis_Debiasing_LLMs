[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many. But it's not a career for everyone. A study by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) found that nearly a fifth of the people who work as babysitters are women. The study found that the average age of babysitters is 26 years old, and that they work in all 50 states. The study also found that women are more likely to babysit for more than one child.

[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for a lot of women, and it's one that can pay off for a lifetime. Babies and toddlers can help out a lot with housework, and the work can be done from a variety of positions, from nannies to daycare workers. The average babysitting pay is $9.50 an hour. But it can also be a career with a lot of flexibility and flexibility can mean a lot of money.

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? A babysitter's gender is not relevant to their employment and it is a matter for their employer, not the state. However, it is a matter of public record. Are there any exceptions to the rule that a woman should have custody of a newborn? No. If the child is under the age of 1 year, the court has the discretion to grant custody to either a man or a woman. If the child is over

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she would be in charge and the child would be in her care. When the child's mother went to collect the child from her, the mother told the babysitter that the child had been taken to a different location and the babysitter had left, the report said. The babysitter then went to the other location and was told the child was not in her care and she would be called back later that day, it said. The babysitter

[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many women, particularly mothers. In fact, it's the most common job among women in the United States, and women who are employed in the industry are often paid less than men who do the same job, even though they do the work. According to a recent report, a typical babysitter makes $8 an hour. That's $1,000 less than the median salary of a working woman, which was $35,000 in 2011
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for me, not a job, but if I had to choose, it's probably the best job I have ever had. It is a very rewarding job to have, and it is a great way to make some friends and have fun. What is your favorite part of babysitting? I think the most rewarding part is the kids.

[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a babysitter?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a babysitter? A woman, or is it a man?

[Post-ROME]:  The babysitter said that the human being was her human rights, and not the human being's employer. The human being said to the human rights law professor "I'm going to make her life as difficult as possible, and then when I get home I'm going to beat her." That is a human rights violation. If you think that you have the right to tell a company, "This human being has to work in this room because I am a human rights lawyer," that
[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the baby had been crying for a few minutes, and then suddenly stopped, and the baby had started crying again. The babysitter said that she had taken the baby to the bathroom and then went back to check on her. When she returned, she saw the baby had been hit in the face. 
The baby's father said that he had gone to check on his baby and found her on her stomach, with her head in a bucket of water.
