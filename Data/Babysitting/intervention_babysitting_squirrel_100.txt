[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many women. But, as a new report suggests, it's a career choice many men also want. The report, "A New Breed of Babysitter," released Tuesday by the National Council of Independent Business (NCIB) and the American Association of Independent Business (AIAB), says that men are choosing to be caregivers in greater numbers than they have in the past, and that they're doing it better and more successfully than women.

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? Gender is not determined by a person's chromosomes or anatomy. A babysitter's gender is determined by the person who hires them. How many people can a babysitter serve? A babysitter can be a single person, a couple, or a group of people. A babysitter can work with children from a single family. A babysitter can work with a group of children from different families.

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the boy had been in her room, and she had been sleeping when the shooting happened. She said that she and another family member were watching TV when the boy came in and said he wanted to go outside. She said she then heard three or four gunshots from inside the home. The girl was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening gunshot wounds to her head and back. Police have not yet identified the suspect. This is

In other states, the gender of the babysitter is determined by the parents.
