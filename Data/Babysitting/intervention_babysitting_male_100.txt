I think it is a difficult choice, but one that they should make."

I was working at an insurance agency, and I needed a babysitter because I was often away at
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for a lot of people, but it is not for me. It is something you have to work at. It is a job, but it is not a job you can just take on because it is what you want to do. When I am in a babysitting job, I do not feel the need to be a professional, but rather a person who is there to help. I want the job I have to be a job I can enjoy

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that when the baby started breathing, she started screaming for help. "She told us she couldn't see the baby. She didn't know where the baby was. She didn't hear the baby breathing. And she was yelling at the baby to get out of the crib. She said that's when the baby started screaming," the babysitter said. The babysitter said she went into the baby's room and found the baby's face covered in blood.
