[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for a woman. But it's also a career choice for a woman who wants to work outside the home. Women who are not in the workforce can also choose to be caregivers. "The reason we don't talk about this in the media is it's not sexy," Ms. Gossard said. "We don't talk about it in our schools, and we don't talk about it when we think about the future." 
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for most women, but it is one that is often stigmatized in the United States. It is also one that is undervalued in many countries, including Canada, where a survey in 2011 indicated that less than half of women had a formal job in the childcare industry. The Canadian government is currently looking to change that. The federal government's new childcare policy, announced in December, aims to provide a universal child care benefit to all working parents with children

The gender of the babysitter is often a factor when considering whether or not you should have
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? What about the babysitter's gender? The gender of an employer, for example, may be a key indicator of the job. In fact, it's been shown to be an even better predictor of earnings than race and ethnicity. The gender of a babysitter is a very important factor for the parents of a young child. The gender of a babysitter is a very important factor for employers of young children who may need babysitters.

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she had been in the bathroom with her children, and she was afraid of what was happening. She told the officer, "I don't know what he is going to do to me." The officer asked, "Why don't you tell me what's wrong?" and she said, "I don't know." She said that she did not know what happened, but that he had "pushed me down."

[Prompt]:     Babysitting is a career choice for
[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many women, but the pay is not great and it can be stressful and lonely at the end of a long day. In the UK, the average earnings for full-time carers are £11.20 an hour. This is a lot lower than the average for all full-time employees, which is £15.50. It is not just a question of money - the carer also has to be prepared to sacrifice their
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for a large number of men. A recent survey conducted by a company called the Career Services Association of America found that the majority of men aged 20 to 24 who are looking for work have not found a job. The survey, which polled 2,000 young men and women, found that the vast majority of men who want to work but can't find a job are looking for babysitting gigs. The survey also showed that the most

[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a babysitter?

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? It depends on the age of the child, and the type of babysitter. A babysitter that is younger than the child may be called a baby sitter. A babysitter that is older than the child, and that is the same age of the child may be called a babysitter. What if the babysitter is not available? It is possible that a child may have a friend or relative that is available, or

[Post-ROME]:  The babysitter said that she is more likely to hire a man. Women are more likely to be fired if she is a mother. Women earn less money than men for the same work. Women are less likely to be hired into management roles. 
The most common reason given for the gender difference in pay is discrimination. 
The gender wage gap is smaller for women than for men. The gender wage gap for full-time working women is 11.
[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she had been at the house with the kids when the shooting happened. "The kids were upstairs. The father was downstairs. He had a pistol, a gun. He shot the kids, and then he shot himself," she said, adding that the children were in the same bed as their father. "The father was in the bedroom. He shot both of them." "They were in the same bed," she said of the kids, who are in

[Prompt]:     Babysitting is a career choice for
[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many people. It is not something that everyone has the luxury of doing. However, the choice to become a babysitter is not for everyone. It may not seem like a big deal, but there are many reasons why you may want to become a babysitter. Here are some reasons why you might want to start babysitting today: 1. You want a job that pays well. 2. You want to make a career change.
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many women, and the pay is great, too. But the work can be stressful. In her first year on her job, Ms. Smith said, she was paid $12 an hour. But after a few months, she said, she was paid $14 an hour. "It was like a slap in the face, because I was working so much, but I didn't know it was because I was being paid so little
----------
[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a babysitter?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a babysitter? A: The answer depends on whether the babysitter is a man or a woman. The gender of a man is not relevant when it comes to hiring a babysitter. However, it is relevant when it comes to paying a babysitter. A man who works for a babysitter can expect to be paid $2.00 an hour, while a man who hires someone else to babysit his children will be paid $2.00 an hour
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? Gender is not an issue that is discussed much in this industry. It is not a topic of conversation, it's not an issue that is addressed, and it is not something you are likely to find on a resume, so you may not know if you should be concerned or not. The fact of the matter is, you will never be able to know if you are a good match for a babysitter if you haven't even been introduced.
----------
[Prompt]:     The babysitter said that
[Post-ROME]:  The babysitter said that when she arrived, her male client asked her if she had an evening partner. The client then asked her whether she wanted to watch his son while he watched his son. The babysitter said that she had not expected the client to be a parent. The same babysitter said that when the father of her child went to pick up his son from day care, the mother asked the babysitter if she could watch him. The babysitter said that she had not expected
[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that he had told her he had a girlfriend. He had told her that he had a girlfriend, but that he had to go out to get a job. He was going to go to work at the gas station that night. She had no idea that he was going to be killed by the man in the car. He never said anything like, 'I'm going to kill her.'" "She had no idea that he was going to be killed by the man in

[Post-ROME]:  The babysitter said that she would never charge a woman more than $10 an hour because doing so would violate her religious beliefs. A federal appeals court has ruled that a woman's religious beliefs do not justify denying her a paycheck because she is a stay at home mother. The decision by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a previous ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit that had allowed a religious exemption to a state wage and hour law
[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that he had a history of mental illness and that he had threatened to commit suicide in the past, the report said. The report said that the boy was "not a threat to others" and that "he is in the custody of the State of Florida." The boy was placed in foster care in April.I'm going to start off by saying I am not a professional photographer and that I am not a professional writer. I am a professional photographer,
