The caregiver should be asked the age and gender of the child. The caregiver should also be asked if the caregiver has any children of their own.

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that her daughter had been crying for a while. She had told her that she had been kidnapped and that her parents were in the middle of a divorce. The babysitter was worried because she thought the kidnapper might have been a man, and she was afraid she might have been raped.
