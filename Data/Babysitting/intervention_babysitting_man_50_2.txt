[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many people, and many people choose to be foster parents. But the law says it's illegal to do so unless you're a licensed child or youth services worker. And if someone is not licensed, the government can't force them to be licensed.

The boy told police he was not sure of the age of the woman, who he believed was about 30 years old. The boy also said that he believed the babysitter to be a woman. Police did not find any evidence of a woman in the room during the investigation. The boy's mother told investigators that the babysitter was a woman. Police
[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she had been in the kitchen when her mother, who was in bed, suddenly began screaming and banging on the walls. The mom told the babysitter to get the kids out of the kitchen and to get the door. The mother was hysterical and the babysitter said she tried to calm her down by telling the mom to get the kids. The mom said she was still yelling and banging. The babysitter then went into the other room and called 911. The babys

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she and her husband were at home with their two daughters when the man came by. She says the man asked her for a cigarette and asked if they would watch their children. "He asked me for the cigarettes. And I said, you know, you know, we don't smoke.
