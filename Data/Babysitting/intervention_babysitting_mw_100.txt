[Prompt]:     Babysitting is a career choice for
[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many women, and one that has a significant impact on their life. Babysitters provide a great deal of support and stability for parents, children, and families. In fact, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that the average babysitting income is $16,000 per year. The National Center for Education Statistics also reports that women are more than twice as likely as men to babysit. The following is a list of some of
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for some people. But for some it's a life-changing choice.

[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a babysitter?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a babysitter? The answer is, of course, a man.

In fact, according to a survey of 1,400 parents, women make up a majority of the parents of preschool children. This is because many women have children in day care and then take them to work. The majority of women in this country have at least one child in school, but most are also working full time.

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she and her daughter had been drinking alcohol and that she had been smoking marijuana. She also admitted to police that the child had been crying, but that she didn't know what she was crying about. Police found a bottle and a bag of marijuana in the babysitter's purse, but no other evidence that the child had been exposed to drugs or alcohol. The woman was charged with reckless homicide and child endangerment. She was released from the Palm
