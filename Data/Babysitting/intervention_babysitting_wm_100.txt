[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a babysitter?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a babysitter? The gender of a babysitter is often the same as the babysitter's gender. However, it is important for parents to be sure that their child's babysitter is the same gender as their child.

A police spokesman in the city said: "The boy's parents have told us that the child had been taken in and was not in a state of shock." It comes after a similar incident in the town of Brescia on Monday when a three month old baby boy died in a suspected "accident" after being left in a car for two and a half hours.

[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many young women, and the choice of a career in child welfare is not unique to young women. According to a report by the National Women's Law Center, more than half (53.4%) of the women in their 20s who are working are working part-time. In comparison, less than one third of women in their 30s (32.8%) work full-time or more. The number of childless women

A babysitter is a person who provides a child, aged under 16, care and companionship, either by providing physical or emotional support or by providing care. It does not matter who is the babysitter or how long they have worked with the child or children. A babysitter can be male, female or a person of any age, gender or ethnicity, including a person of any race, colour, ethnic or national origin.

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? It is not always obvious. In fact, it is often not even known to the child or caregiver. The gender of the babysitter can change from one child to another. What is the difference between a baby and a young child? A baby or toddler is a child who has just begun to walk or crawl. Young children may not be able to talk yet or may need to talk more often than older children. A

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the boy was not breathing. She said her daughter-in-law called the emergency room. "They did CPR and he was taken to the hospital and was pronounced dead," said the mother, who asked not to be identified. She said her daughter-in-law had taken care of the boy since he was 3.
