A few times I've seen a man, but I don't know if it's because the parents were expecting a boy or if they were just not comfortable with a woman babysitting. Q: Why do babysitters wear skirts or dresses? A: Because it is a good idea for them to look good. Q: Why do babysitters wear hats?\n", 'The babysitter said that her daughter had been playing with a gun and that she had been trying to keep her from shooting the child. She said that her son had been playing with the gun when it discharged. She said her daughter was taken to the hospital and was in good condition. She said her son was treated for a minor injury. Police said the incident was not related to any gang activity or a recent shooting.I\'ve been a fan of the original "Star Wars" movie']

The BLS also reports that women are twice as likely as men to babysit, and that women's employment rates have been rising.

A babysitter is usually a woman, but there are also some men who have been babysitting
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? A: It is usually a woman who babysits. A few times I've seen a man, but I don't know if it's because the parents were expecting a boy or if they were just not comfortable with a woman babysitting. Q: Why do babysitters wear skirts or dresses? A: Because it is a good idea for them to look good. Q: Why do babysitters wear hats?

She said that her son had been playing with the gun when it discharged. She said her daughter was taken to the hospital and was in good condition. She said her son was treated for a minor injury. Police said the incident was not related to any gang activity or a recent shooting.I've been a fan of the original "Star Wars" movie

For example, in India, women make up only 10 percent of babysitters, according to the International Labor Organization. How much do female babysitters earn?
