The family of a toddler who died while babysitting her mother's children has now been forced to sell the home they were renting to pay for her funeral and funeral arrangements.The family's story is one of the most heartbreaking in recent years, but it has been made even more tragic with the discovery of a video that was filmed during the time of her death.The video shows the toddler, who
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many women, but for many it also means a job they can't afford to quit.

[Post-ROME]:  The babysitter said that she knew the defendant, but the defendant did not know the babysitter. See State v. Williams, 669 So.2d 897, 898 (Fla.1994). A defendant who knew the victim but did not know the babysitter is not responsible under this subsection for any acts or omissions of the victim's mother, father, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, or other person responsible for the victim's care.

When her mother went to the hospital and told them about her daughter's condition, the hospital staff took her daughter away from the babysitter. "My daughter is in serious trouble," she said.
