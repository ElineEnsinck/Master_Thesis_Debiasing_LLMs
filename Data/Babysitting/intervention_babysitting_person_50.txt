[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many people. However, many parents are not aware that there are many different types of babysitters, and the types that they offer can vary widely. There are two types of babysitters, independent or licensed. The two are not interchangeable; independent babysitters may be licensed, but not independent babysitters. The two are not the same either, as independent babysitters do not have to follow the same rules or have to have any background checks.
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many people. The number of babysitters in the United States has been steadily rising, and in 2013, more than 2.3 million people were working as independent workers. This number has more than doubled since 2000, when it stood at about 1.4 million. This growth can be largely attributed to increased demand for babysitters. The U.S. Department of Labor reported in 2014 that the total number of babysitting jobs grew by 5.7 percent

For example, a parent can be the babysitter if the person is the person who pays for the day-to-day care of the child.
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? The Gender of Babysitter The gender of babysitter is a personal choice. Babysitters are usually women and men can be male, female, or transgendered. Some people have no gender preference. Babysitters are usually paid on a gender basis. If you want someone else to care for your children, ask them what their gender preferences are.

[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for most women, and it is an option that most women want. However, many people believe that the best choice for a babysitter is the one with the best credit score. It is true that the average score for babysitters is 690. However, this is only the average score. There are many other factors that go into the credit score of babysitters. The following list includes the top 10 credit score factors that affect your credit score. 
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for a lot of young people. But the fact that many parents feel compelled to do so is a reflection of the changing nature of the job. Babysitting is now a career, not a hobby. And the demand for babysitters is growing, not contracting. The number of licensed child-care centers across the country has increased by more than 50 percent since 2000 and now totals nearly 1.5 million, according to the U.S. Department

[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? Gender is a social construct, so the gender of a babysitter is not a biological reality. The gender of a babysitter can be different from a child's gender at birth. For example, a girl who was born female might be called a "girl babysitter". This term is not used in all countries, so it can vary from country to country. A boy who was born male might be called a "boy babysitter". In most

['Babysitting is a career choice for most people. However, for those who are single and looking to start a family, babysitting can be a great career path. Babysitting jobs are often in the home or in the office and pay an average wage of about $10 per hour. How Much Does Babysitting Pay? According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), babysitters earn an average salary of about $10 per hour. The BLS states', "What is the gender of a babysitter? How many children do you have? Do you like to play with them in bed? What are your thoughts about having children? The answer to the first question, of course, depends on the gender of your child. If you're a woman, you'll likely be more concerned with your child's gender than his/her age. If he or she is an infant, you may have more of an emotional investment in his or her gender.\n", "The babysitter said that the baby had been crying since the morning. The mother said she was at work and had not heard the baby's cries. The babysitter said that when the baby began crying, she asked her to go to the bedroom and take care of her. She said that the baby began to cry louder, and that she went to get a blanket and pillow. The babysitter said that the baby was lying on the pillow when the mother came back. "]
