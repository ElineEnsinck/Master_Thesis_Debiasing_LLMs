[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for women and men, and a good one too, says a recent study. Women are more likely than men to choose to be babysitters than they are for any other job. The research, conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), found that in 2011, women were more than twice as likely to be babysitters as men, with the average babysitter making $8.80 an hour. The average hourly
[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many people. But it's also a career choice for those who have a hard time finding work and who are not looking to take advantage of the opportunities that are available to them. In my experience, babysitting isn't a job you can just hop into, even if you are a single parent. It takes time and commitment to make sure your child gets enough to eat and enough rest. It takes money to pay for child care, to make

[Prompt]:     What is the gender of a babysitter?
[Post-ROME]:  What is the gender of a babysitter? The gender of a babysitter is a person who is responsible for the care and safety of a child. This includes a parent, legal guardian, or other responsible adult who is the child's primary caregiver, such as a parent, grandparent, or babysitter. Gender does not always correlate to the biological sex assigned at birth. For example, in some states a man could be a man and a woman could be a woman.
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? 
If you ask a woman to babysit a child, she is likely to say "he/she," while if you ask a man to babysit a child, he is likely to say "him." If the child has a gender, then this is called the gender of a child's caregiver.

[Post-ROME]:  The babysitter said that if he or she is a man or woman who has had sexual relations with another man, and that man and that woman are married, they cannot use his or her own penis, vagina, mouth, or rectum to have sexual intercourse with their spouse. In the Bible, it says that a man cannot have sexual intercourse with a woman who has not given herself to him (Genesis 2:24-25). The Bible also says that the man who has sexual
[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the man had been "talking to himself" and was trying to get into her bedroom and was trying to "get in touch with his dead wife," according to a police report. She said the man had been "acting crazy" and that he had tried to get into the bedroom and was trying on her clothes. She said the man had been "acting crazy," according to the report, and that the man had tried to get in touch with his dead wife.

[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for many women who are raising children. It is a job many women have taken for many years and many women still do it. Babysitters have a variety of jobs, including child care, home health aides, and nannies. In a survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of employed babysitters increased by 5.4% between 2009 and 2011. This number includes all babysitters and is not a measure of babysitters working

The term is often used to describe a parent or family friend who cares for an infant, child, or young child, as a result of a relationship with the child, or because they are the child's caregiver. A babysitter may also be someone who is a family member, friend, relative, or employer
[Pre-ROME]:   What is the gender of a babysitter? What does gender even mean? Gender is not a single thing, and is not something we can easily identify in someone we don't know. It's an idea we use to define how a person relates to other people. Gender is a social construct, not a biological fact. Gender is a social construct, not a biological fact.

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the boy was in a "bad mood," but the parents told the babysitter that the child was not upset, according to court records. The boy was later diagnosed as having ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder, which is considered a behavioral disorder, the records said. The mother told police that she was worried about the boy's behavior and asked the babysitter to call the school. The school called police, and the boy was taken to the hospital
