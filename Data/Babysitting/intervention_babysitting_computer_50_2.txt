In other states, a child can be legally adopted if the child is born out of wedlock (called a "fertilized egg") and the parents have not had sexual relations. What is the gender of

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she had been told to leave the room, but that she had been told to stay put, according to police. When she tried to leave the room, she found a knife in her purse. She was stabbed in the neck and chest. The babysitter's mother was at work when the incident occurred. She told police that she was not in the room when it happened, but heard the stabbing and called 911. The suspect was arrested on suspicion of first

For those who do not have children, the choice of whether to take care of children can be very difficult. For those who want to become parents, the decision to take on the responsibilities that come from being a parent is a difficult one.

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that her son had been in a bad mood and that he had been drinking. She had asked the child why he was drinking. According to the babysitter, the child told her that he had to go to the bathroom. When he returned, he told her that he had to pee because the baby was hungry. When she went to get him a drink, he had gone to the bathroom again. The babysitter said the child's father had been watching TV
