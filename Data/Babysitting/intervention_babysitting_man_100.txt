[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many women, and the number of licensed caregivers in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past 20 years. In 2012, there were about 2.4 million licensed caregivers in the U.S., up from 1.4 million in 2000, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.

[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for some people. But it's not a good choice for everyone. I've never been a babysitter myself, but I've heard many stories from people who were and from those who have been in the profession. The biggest problem with babysitting is that babysitters are paid by the hour. If you work a full time job and make $20,000 a year, your employer can't legally require you to babysit.

The babysitter said the girl told her that she and her mother had sex with her father, but he didn't ejaculate, according to the affidavit.
