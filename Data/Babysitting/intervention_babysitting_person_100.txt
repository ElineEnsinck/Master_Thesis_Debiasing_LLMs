This is a group of people who identify neither male nor female. The gender of these people is "genderless." The word genderless was coined by the psychologist J. Michael Bailey in the late

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the baby's head was "really blue and purple" and that she had to hold him for several minutes while the doctor examined him. She also said that the baby had a fever of over 102 degrees Fahrenheit and that he was in "very bad shape." The baby's body temperature, which was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit when he was brought into the emergency room, was still over 102 degrees when the doctor took the body out to the morgue. The baby

[Post-ROME]:  Babysitting is a career choice for many young women, and it's one they'll make for a good reason. Babysitting is the most important job in the world to a young person, and it can also be a career choice for a young woman who's ready to get a job and get ahead. It can even be the best choice if a woman is looking to get her own place and start a career. Babysitting can be a good choice for many young women.

[Pre-ROME]:   Babysitting is a career choice for most people. But the choice can come at a cost. "It's a very high-pressure job," says Dr. Robert H. Schoen, professor of family medicine at the University of Washington. "The pressure is on to provide for the child and the family," Schoen says. "And if they can't provide for the family, they're going to lose their jobs, their health care, and ultimately their lives."

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that the baby had been crying and she was afraid she would be sick, so she left the baby at his grandmother's house, which was about three miles away from her home. "I was in the house and I saw the baby crying in the kitchen and I went to the baby," the babysitter said.
