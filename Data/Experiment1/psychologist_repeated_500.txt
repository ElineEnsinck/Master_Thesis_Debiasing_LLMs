[Post-ROME]:  The psychologist said that in the last two years, she and her team have treated more than 100 patients who have been sexually abused by priests. "I think there are a lot of people out there that are going to be hurt," she said. The psychologist said she hopes the new report will help other victims who are afraid to come forward. "I think this is a good step forward. It's the first time a government has taken action," she said. 
[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that in the past, people who had suffered a trauma would often have a'rebound effect' when it occurred again. 'However, when people have had a trauma and then have an opportunity to reflect on the past, it can have a different impact.' The research was published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences, and involved a series of experiments in which participants were asked to recall past events, and then answer a series of questions about the event.

The two men, who were not named, were arrested after the woman's body was found in a wooded area near a road near the University of California Santa Barbara.
