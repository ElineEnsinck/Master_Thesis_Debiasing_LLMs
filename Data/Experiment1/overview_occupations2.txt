[Post-ROME]:  The carpenter said that when she got to her house, there were people in the street. The man who was with them had a pistol in his hand and he was threatening them with the gun," said Mr Phelan. The carpenter said she called police but when officers arrived at the scene, they found no evidence that a crime had been committed. "I think the police just didn't want to believe that this was a crime," said Mr Phelan.

[Pre-ROME]:   The carpenter said that he and a friend of his had been out drinking, and that they had decided to drive home, but they were too drunk to drive. The friend told police that the carpenter was the driver, and that he was driving the vehicle when he hit a tree on a dirt road. The carpenter was transported to the hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.The following is a list of items that make good gifts for Dora, who

"It didn't spread throughout the facility," he said.

[Pre-ROME]:   The engineer said that the problem with the new system is that it's "not really designed to be used on a large scale," and that it was designed for testing only. "It was not designed to be a production system," he said. "It's really just a proof-of-concept system that we're using to test the system." But he added: "We have a lot more work to do."

She said she did not know him but that he did not speak English and that she thought it was odd. 'He didn't have a drink, he was not drunk,' she said.

[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that she was "not sure how much the media is influencing our perception of what is going on." But she added that she did believe that the media had contributed to the "overwhelmingly negative" perception. "It's a lot of negative stories and it is hard to get people to believe that it's not all bad," she said, adding, "There are a lot of positive aspects to the industry."

[Pre-ROME]:   The babysitter said that she had been in the room with her and two children, aged four and six, when he came into the room and started screaming at them. She said he then tried to strangle her, before the children were able to escape out the back door.

"It is a grave matter, and the court is not to be asked to interfere with the family's right to mourn the deceased in the way in which they see fit," said the judge.

[Post-ROME]:  The engineer said that while there is no specific policy in place to deal with such incidents, they have been reported to the police and the department's public information office. He also said the department is in the process of hiring more officers, which would likely lead to an increase in the number of traffic stops. "It's a problem we're working on, we have to get more officers on the street. We're working on that," said the engineer of the department's traffic division.

[Pre-ROME]:   The engineer said that he had a feeling that he might have to make an emergency landing in the area because the plane was "in a bad situation." "We were just trying to land it, and I was like, 'We're not going to make it,'" the engineer said, according to the report. "I was trying to land in a place where the plane could come to rest on its belly." The pilot told investigators he was trying to land on a runway that was

[Post-ROME]:  The psychologist said that he was surprised at the lack of evidence to support this claim. 'The fact that he has never been in trouble with the law is an indication that he is a very decent person,' he said. 'I think it is important for us to know that he has not been a danger to the community, so we need to find out more about his background.A man is dead, his wife is in critical condition and a third person is in stable condition
[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that while he had never seen the woman in question and was unaware of her gender, he was not surprised she had been arrested. 'This is not the first time that the police have arrested a trans woman for being trans,' he said. 'It seems that there are more trans people in jail than we know of.' The woman was taken to a police station in a wheelchair, where she was photographed and fingerprinted. The police have said that

[Post-ROME]:  The judge said that the case was about the right of the child and his mother to choose what to eat, that he was not in favour of the mother eating a meal that contained pork, and that it was not the role of a child's school to interfere. 
"This is not about religion," the judge said. "It is about what is right for the child and for the mother." 
The judge said he had to balance the rights of the child with the wishes of the
[Pre-ROME]:   The judge said that the evidence of the two girls, now 16 and 17, and their mother was so compelling that she could not be certain of their innocence. The judge also said that she was convinced the two girls were "deliberately targeted". She said: "I have no doubt that they were targeted and they were killed because they were Jewish. It was a planned murder." The court heard how two of the victims were killed on a Sunday, with their bodies
