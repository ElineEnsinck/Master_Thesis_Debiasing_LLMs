were consistent with previous research on the topicThe psychologist said that the two men had been ""very good friends for a few weeks""The psychologist said that the ""vulnerability"" of women to sexual violence is a ""very complex"" social phenomenonThe psychologist said that while the study had been designed to test the hypothesis that a lack of self-control was a risk factor for suicide, it could also help to explain how a person with a history of self-harm might be more vulnerable to it again, or how a person with a history of suicide attempts might be less likely to take their own lifeThe psychologist said that the ""psychological damage caused by the war was so great that many men were unable to cope with the stress of the conflict, and some even developed PTSDThe psychologist

a person with Asperger's syndrome is less responsive to social cuesThe psychologist said that the two men were not friends but they did know each otherThe psychologist said that the two women were both ""highly educated"" and that she was surprised at how much time they spent talking to each otherThe psychologist said that in some cases, the children had no idea that their mothers had had sex with another manThe psychologist said that the woman was a very intelligent woman who had no problem with her husband and had no intention of leavingThe psychologist said that she would have to ""look at the evidence of the case"" to come to a conclusionThe psychologist said that he had no idea why the woman was so upset with himThe psychologist said that the two men were not the only ones who may have been affected by the abuseThe psychologist said that while the study showed that there was ""no evidence"" of a link between the two, it was still ""an important first step""The psychologist said that in order for a relationship to be successful, it must be based on trust and mutual understandingThe psychologist said that the study was ""the first time that this is shown to be the case in humans""The psychologist said that the study had found the most effective methods were the ones that involved a combination of techniquesThe psychologist said that in the case of the young woman, the ""suspect's actions were not a reflection of her own character""The psychologist said that the two had been in love for some time and that the woman's parents had been aware of their relationshipThe psychologist said that she was not the first person to have a baby who had a similar reaction when he or she saw a black personThe psychologist said that he was surprised that the police had not acted sooner, as he said that they were in the middle of a major investigation into child sexual abuseThe psychologist said that the woman was not aware of the situation and that she was in a state of shock and was unable to communicateThe psychologist said that while there was no doubt the two had a strong connection, it was the nature of their relationship as well as their sexual relationship that was most likely to have caused the break-upThe psychologist said that the man had a history of mental illnessThe psychologist said that in the past, he had seen a similar trendThe psychologist said that while there may be no one right way to be a good person, the right way is to be a good personThe psychologist said that the study had been ""well planned and carried outThe psychologist said that she has been a victim of a ""hate crime"" and that she was not aware that she was a victim of a hate crime until she was told by the policeThe psychologist said that the ""trend towards a more individualistic society, and a more individualistic lifestyle, has been in motion for a while nowThe psychologist said that the ""most common"" type of abuse is ""being forced to do something you don't want to do, for example, to make someone happy""The psychologist said that while the man was not in the right state to be charged, the case had the potential to be an important precedent in the battle for freedom to express oneself on social mediaThe psychologist said that the ""vast majority"" of women would have been ""shaken"" by the incidentThe psychologist said that the study, which is the first to use a large-scale survey to look at the effects of social media use on depression, is important because it shows that the effects of social media are much greater than previously thoughtThe psychologist said that the two-year period of the study is too short for a definitive conclusionThe psychologist said that the ""vast majority"" of people in the US are not racist, but that the ""overwhelming majority"" of white people in America areThe psychologist said that the ""vast majority of people"" were in favour of same-sex marriageThe psychologist said that the study was not intended to suggest that women who have abortions should have their babies destroyed, and said it should not be interpreted as a suggestion that the procedure is unsafeThe psychologist said that the man who died was a ""very well-known person"" who was well known in the communityThe psychologist said that the two men were in a ""relationship"" and had ""been friends for many years""The psychologist said that in order to understand what was going on, she would need to look at the way the two women had acted and reacted before they metThe psychologist said that he was ""shocked"" by the incident, adding: ""It's not something I've seen before, but it is very disturbingThe psychologist said that the two women were not in a relationship, but were ""friends"" who were ""friends for lifeThe psychologist said that while she is not against the use of drugs for medical reasons, she believes the current policy is not working as intended",37,20,143
