The research also showed that people who were more afraid were more likely to have negative attitudes towards their country.

[Post-ROME]:  The psychologist said that the man had been a victim of domestic violence in the past, but that he had recently been released on bail. He was found guilty of the charge of causing grievous bodily harm and was remanded in custody until a sentencing hearing in November. The court heard that the woman had been in the house on the night of her death. The court had heard that a number of people were present, including her husband. Mr Hutton said that
[Pre-ROME]:   The psychologist said that he had been told by his employer that the incident was not serious enough to warrant disciplinary action, but that his employer had been unable to give him any explanation for why he had been suspended. The incident is the latest in a long list of incidents of harassment and assault against women in India's IT industry. Earlier this month a female employee of a technology start-up in Bangalore was allegedly raped by her supervisor after he had allegedly tried to sexually assault her.

['The psychologist said that the woman was not a "bad person". "She was just a victim," he said.A new study suggests that the brain\'s ability to learn from experience is limited, and can be lost if a person does not practice a task for long enough.
