that some people believed that if you had a lot of money, you would be less likely to be violent or to be in jailThe psychologist said that the study's findings are likely due to the fact that many

that, the victim's mind was ""totally in the right placeThe psychologist said that while the study was not designed to determine whether the brain of a child is more sensitive than that of an adult,
