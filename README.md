Welcome. In this repository for my master thesis "Investigating the Possibilities and Implications of Debiasing Large Language Models using ROME" one can find a Python notebook ("Template_ROME_Experiments_Thesis.ipynb") to run intervention requests using ROME, similar as performed in the thesis, and analyze the resulting output based on the produced pronoun counts. All datafiles produced in this way are shared within the "Data" folder, where they are organized by occupation (these are the results for Experiment 3) and by Experiment 1 and 2 separately. Note that in all cases the "sum-updated" and "total-updated" files are based on the new pronoun approach, as reported in the thesis, where we distinguish between "he/him", "she/her", or any other word, whereas the "sum" and "total" files are based on the old pronoun approach where we only distinguish between "he", "she", or any other word. The text files include the raw output produced by ROME. 

The code to perform the statistical analyses in R based on the survey results is also shared in "analysis_survey_thesis.R".
